MACRO OUTLOOK — STOCK MARKET 2025

1. GOLDMAN SACHS RESEARCH — GLOBAL STOCKS & VALUATIONS
Global equities are expected to make further progress in 2025 backed by economic growth and earnings trends. However, valuations in the U.S. have reached extended levels, leaving markets *vulnerable to corrections* if economic data or earnings disappoint. Growth expectations and higher stock prices have already priced in much of the good news, particularly in the Magnificent 7 and other technology segments. High concentration and stretched valuations are cited as key risks for the equity backdrop.

Key themes:
- Continued equity market strength
- Vulnerability from high valuations
- Market concentration risk
- Dependence on economic data and earnings surprises

2. BANK OF AMERICA GLOBAL RESEARCH — EQUITY STRENGTH AMID UNCERTAINTY
Bank of America’s outlook calls for strong performance of U.S. equities in 2025 despite macro uncertainty. The U.S. economy is forecasted to grow above consensus, supported by productivity and fiscal policy dynamics. S&P 500 earnings are expected to accelerate, and the index could reach new highs by year-end. Rate cuts from the Federal Reserve are expected early in the year, with bond yields remaining in a tight range. Macro risks like policy shifts and global uneven responses are highlighted.

3. MORGAN STANLEY OUTLOOK — MUTED GAINS BUT OPPORTUNITIES
Morgan Stanley’s 2025 view suggests that after two strong years of returns, further gains in the stock market are likely but **more muted** compared with prior years. The continued adoption of technology, including AI productivity gains, is seen as a positive driver. Investors are advised to monitor overextended valuation drivers and net fund flows for signs of euphoria, especially in equities. [oai_citation:2‡Morgan Stanley](https://www.morganstanley.com/insights/articles/stock-market-outlook-2025?utm_source=chatgpt.com)

Key themes:
- Growth likely but moderated
- AI productivity potentially underpins earnings
- Watch for euphoria/valuation risk

4. MORGAN STANLEY MIDYEAR — U.S. ASSETS FAVORED
A mid-year update highlighted that equities and high-quality fixed income should provide reasonable returns even as global growth slows. Investors may favor U.S. assets, with projections for the S&P 500 to climb toward elevated levels by mid-2026. A weaker U.S. dollar and commodities dynamics may be tailwinds for certain sectors, while fixed income also offers opportunities.

5. DWS MARKET & MACRO OUTLOOK — SLOWER ECONOMIC GROWTH
European and U.S. economic growth in 2025 is expected to be modest. Tariffs and global trade friction could dampen consumption and investment. Inflation remains a risk, while central banks act cautiously to balance price stability with growth. More rate cuts may materialize by mid-2026, but geopolitical escalation and rising rates remain key risk factors that could weigh on capital markets.
