WARREN BUFFETT–STYLE STOCK MARKET PHILOSOPHY
===========================================

Core Principle
--------------
Buy high-quality businesses at reasonable prices and hold them for the long term.
Ignore short-term market noise.

1. Think Like a Business Owner
------------------------------
- Buy stocks as if you are buying the entire business.
- Understand how the company makes money.
- Avoid businesses you cannot clearly explain.

2. Circle of Competence
-----------------------
- Invest only in industries you understand well.
- Do not chase trends or hype.
- Staying within your knowledge is more important than being smart.

3. Economic Moat
----------------
Look for companies with durable competitive advantages:
- Strong brand (Apple, Coca-Cola)
- High switching costs
- Network effects
- Cost advantages
- Regulatory protection

A strong moat protects profits over decades.

4. Financial Strength
---------------------
Focus on companies with:
- Consistent revenue and earnings growth
- High return on equity (ROE)
- Low or manageable debt
- Strong free cash flow

Avoid companies that rely heavily on debt to survive.

5. Management Quality
---------------------
- Honest and shareholder-friendly management
- Rational capital allocation
- Avoid flashy executives who overpromise

Good management treats shareholders like partners.

6. Margin of Safety
-------------------
- Buy when a stock is priced below its intrinsic value.
- Allow room for error in your assumptions.
- It is better to buy a great company at a fair price than a bad company at a cheap price.

7. Long-Term Holding
--------------------
- Preferred holding period: forever.
- Let compounding work over time.
- Minimize buying and selling.

The stock market is a device for transferring money from the impatient to the patient.

8. Ignore Market Noise
----------------------
- Do not react to daily price movements.
- Ignore short-term predictions, news, and market fear.
- Market volatility is an opportunity, not a risk.

9. Concentration Over Diversification
-------------------------------------
- Hold a focused portfolio of your best ideas.
- Over-diversification reduces returns.
- Know your holdings deeply.

10. Avoid Speculation
---------------------
- No day trading.
- No market timing.
- No leverage.
- No complex financial instruments you do not understand.

Final Rule
----------
Rule #1: Never lose money.
Rule #2: Never forget Rule #1.

True risk is not volatility — it is permanent loss of capital.
