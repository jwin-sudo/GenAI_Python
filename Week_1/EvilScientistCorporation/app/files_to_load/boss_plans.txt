Simmer down!
Thank you, okay.
 
Now, I realize that you guys probably heard
 
about this other villain
who stole the pyramids.
 
Apparently, it's a big deal.
 
People are calling it
the crime of the century and stuff like that.
 
But am I upset? No, I am not!
 
A little, but we have had a
pretty good year ourselves,
 
and you guys are all right in my book.
 
No, no raises!
You're not going to get any raises.
 
What did we do?
 
Well, we stole the Times Square JumboTron!
 
Nice!
Huh?
 
That's how I roll.
 
Yeah, you all like watching football
on that, huh?
 
But that's not all.
 
We stole the Statue of Liberty,
 
the small one from Las Vegas.
 
And I won't even mention the Eiffel Tower!
Also Vegas.
 
Okay, I wasn't going to tell you
about this yet,
 
but I have been working
on something very big!
 
Something that will blow this pyramid thing
out of the water!
 
And thanks to the efforts
of my good friend Dr. Nefario...
 
- Thank you!
- Oh, there he is.
 
He's styling.
 
Now, we have located a shrink ray
 
in a secret lab,
and once we take this shrink ray,
 
we will have the capability
 
to pull off the true crime of the century.
 
We are going to steal...
 
Wait, wait! I haven't told you what it is yet.
 
Hey.
Dave, listen up, please.
 
Next, we are going to steal,
 
pause for effect, the moon!
